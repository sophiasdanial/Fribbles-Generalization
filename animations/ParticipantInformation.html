            <p style="text-align: center;">You are invited to participate in a research study. Read the information below and ask questions about anything you donâ€™t understand before deciding if you wish to take part. If you any questions, please email e0771164@nus.edu.sg<br><br>This online study is interested in exploring the factors influencing how people identify differences and similarities between items. We are particularly interested in how the way people process visually and how giving examples will affect their judgement.

<p style="text-align: center;font-size: 25px;"><strong>Who can participate in the research? What is the expected duration of my participation?</strong></p>
            <div class="box">
                
                <p style="text-align: center;">Participants should be <b>21 years old and above</b>.<br><br>

You should have no significant visual impairments such as colour blindness. It is also necessary to speak or understand English. You <u>must</u> complete this study on a computer.<br><br>

The study is expected to take up to 15 minutes to complete, and you should finish it within one session. This study will be conducted until August 2023. We aim to recruit 520 participants.

            <p style="text-align: center;font-size: 25px;"><strong>What will I do if I take part in this research study?</strong></p>
            <div class="box">
                
                <p style="text-align: center;">This study takes place entirely online and will require you to interact with objects on your screen. There will be three phases.<br><br>

In Phase I, you will undergo a brief training procedure. There will be shapes on the screen that you must identify using the according keyboard board press. In Phase II, you will perform a judgement task, where you will be asked to rate the likelihood of an item belonging to a specific category based on examples you have been given. Lastly, Phase III is a timed reaction task similar to Phase I, where you will have to identify letters as quickly as possible.

            <p style="text-align: center;font-size: 25px;"><strong>What will happen to my data?</strong></p>
            <div class="box">
                
                <p>This study will not collect any identifying personal data. As such, you will be issued a <u>randomly generated ID number</u> should you need to contact the PI.<br><br>

Please be assured that all data will be password protected and kept according to NUS Data Management policies. Following the conclusion of this study, the data set will be published under <a href="https://scholarbank.nus.edu.sg">NUS ScholarBank Depository</a> as an open access dataset. This will allow other researchers to analyse and examine the data.

            <div class="box">
                
                <p>Due to the long duration of 15 minutes, there is a possibility of screen fatigue. Do note that between the phases of the study, you will be able to take breaks so long as you <u>do not close the browser window. </u>.</p>

                <p>.No injury is expected for this research. If you follow the directions of the PI in charge of this research study and you are injured, the NUS will pay the medical expenses for the treatment of that injury.

                <p>If you are participating via Amazon Turk, you will be awarded <b>SGD0.78 (or USD0.55)</b> following the conclusion of the study.</p>

                <p>There is no direct benefit to you by participating in this research study. The knowledge gained may benefit the public in the future. The study hopes that results gained from this study can go towards furthering knowledge of how and why individuals impacted with impaired perceptual processing, such as autism and anxiety, have difficulty distinguishing between dangerous and non-dangerous stimuli.</p>

                <p>Yes, you can. Your decision to participate in this research study is voluntary and completely up to you. You can also withdraw from the research at any time without giving any reasons. Just close the study window and all your experimental data will be discarded. <br><br>Should you decide to withdraw from the study after submission, please email the PI with your ID number.
